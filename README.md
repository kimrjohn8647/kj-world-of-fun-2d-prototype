# KJ’s World of Fun — 2D Prototype

This repository contains an early 2D prototype of KJ’s World of Fun. The original vision for this project is fully photorealistic, but the platform used to generate this version had technical limitations that prevented photorealistic assets and interactions. I continued with the 2D version to explore structure, navigation, and early gameplay flow while working within the constraints of the tool.

## ⚠️ Prototype Disclaimer
This build includes incomplete features, visual limitations, and errors caused by the platform. It does not represent the final look, quality, or style of the real game. A full photorealistic version is planned as a separate project.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Prototype
- Document early development progress  
- Test layout and screen flow  
- Explore interaction structure  
- Capture the first iteration of the world  

## 🌟 Final Vision
The real version of KJ’s World of Fun will be:
- Fully photorealistic  
- Highly interactive  
- Built with modern tools  
- Designed to match my brand’s visual identity  

This repo exists as a development log and stepping stone toward the full experience.
